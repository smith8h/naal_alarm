#### Installation

```yaml
naal_alarm: ^1.0.0
# or
flutter pub add naal_alarm
```

#### Initialization

```dart
void main() {
  // Very important to call before initialize since it 
  // ensures the binding is available and ready before 
  // any native call
  WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized();

  // initialize Required for alarm events to bind with flutter method channel
  FlutterAlarmBackgroundTrigger.initialize();

  runApp(const MyApp());
}

```

```dart
var alarmPlugin = FlutterAlarmBackgroundTrigger();
```

```dart
alarmPlugin.addAlarm(
      // Required
      DateTime.now().add(Duration(seconds: 10)),

      //Optional
      uid: "YOUR_APP_ID_TO_IDENTIFY",
      payload: {"YOUR_EXTRA_DATA":"FOR_ALARM"},

      // screenWakeDuration: For how much time you want 
      // to make screen awake when alarm triggered
      screenWakeDuration: Duration(minutes: 1)
  )
```

#### Receive event when alarm trigger

```dart
alarmPlugin.requestPermission().then((isGranted){
  if(isGranted){
    alarmPlugin.onForegroundAlarmEventHandler((alarm){
      // Perform your action here such as navigation

      // when app is in foreground or background!
      print(alarm.id)
    })
  }
})
